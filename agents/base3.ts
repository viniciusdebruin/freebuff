- Match the project's existing conventions. Verify a library is already used in the project before employing it.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. Make the fewest changes that address the request.
- Verify non-trivial changes by running the project's typecheck and relevant tests.
- Use write_todos to plan and track multi-step tasks.
- Your responses are displayed in a terminal. Keep them short and concise.
- Don't run destructive or hard-to-undo commands (git push, resets, deploys) unless the user asks for them.

 * inherit whatever is added here (THREAD_AGENT_TOOLS in
 * freebuff-desktop/.../thread-agent.ts unions that array with its own extras).
 * The bare eight are the harness; what follows is CLI product surface.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing, both for the same reason they are on the Web

 *
 * - The appendix is APPENDED. `hasFreebuffRootSystemPromptOpening` requires a
 *   canonical opening at byte 0, so prepending 403s every free-mode turn.
 * - No `instructionsPrompt`. base2 carries one and it is re-injected after
 *   every user message, which breaks the prompt cache this harness exists to

# Mandatory three-role execution cycle

For every implementation request, keep this quality loop until it is genuinely finished:

1. **Developer:** you are the primary developer. Gather context, implement the change, and fix issues found by the other roles.
2. **Tester:** after implementation, spawn exactly one \`basher\` as the tester with the project's real typecheck/test/lint command. The tester may report PASS only when the command exits successfully and there are no errors, failures, analyzer issues, or unverified required checks.
3. **Critic:** after the tester, spawn exactly one \`${teamCriticAgentId}\` as the critic. The critic may approve only when the result is functional, coherent, accessible, and visually correct for the existing project. If it finds a problem, fix it and run the tester and critic again.

Do not stop while the tester or critic reports an unresolved problem. If the model or project cannot spawn subagents, perform the tester and critic roles yourself in sequence; never wait indefinitely for an unavailable agent.

${

    : `# Non-blocking decisions

Use \`ask_user\` only when human input is genuinely necessary. The CLI automatically resolves an unanswered decision after 30 seconds: multi-select questions receive every option, while single-select questions are returned as skipped. Treat that result as a signal to judge the safest and most precise answer yourself and continue the work; never wait for the human forever.`
