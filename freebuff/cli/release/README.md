## Why Freebuff?

**Choice of leading models** — The regular CLI picker includes DeepSeek, GPT-5.6 Luna, and MiMo, with DeepSeek V4 Flash 07/31 selected by default.

**Fast** — 5–10× speed up. 3–5× tokens per second compared to Claude, plus context gathering in seconds.

**Loaded** — Built-in web research, browser use, and more.

## FAQ

**How can it be free?** Freebuff is supported by text ads.

**What models do you use?** In full mode, the regular picker includes DeepSeek V4 Flash 07/31, GPT-5.6 Luna, MiMo 2.5, and DeepSeek V4 Pro. DeepSeek V4 Flash 07/31 is the CLI default, and the picker falls back to MiMo 2.5 once your daily premium sessions are used up. Limited mode uses MiMo 2.5. These limits are temporary and exist because the providers serving DeepSeek now charge more than free mode can carry: V4 Pro is one session a day, GPT-5.6 Luna is two sessions a day, and models may serve from a quantized (Q8_0) build.

**Which countries is Freebuff available in?** All countries. Freebuff runs in "full" mode in the US, Canada, UK, EU, and other select countries, and in "limited" mode everywhere else (or while using a VPN). See [freebuff.com](https://freebuff.com) for the full list.

**What is limited mode?** Limited mode lets you use Freebuff outside the full-access countries, or while using a VPN. It includes MiMo 2.5, with 3 one-hour sessions per day, and you can earn up to 7 by engaging with promoted posts on the Earn page.

**Is my data used to train AI?** Only when a model or feature says data may be used for AI training. Freebuff or the provider may then keep submissions to develop, train, test, evaluate, fine-tune, and improve AI models or products.

**How is my data used and stored?** We use prompts, messages, code, files, and repository data to provide the service. We may analyze prompts and messages—including pasted content—to personalize ads, using Freebuff systems and service providers acting on our behalf. Separate uploads and connected repositories are not provided to advertising providers. Where required by law, we provide advertising choices and honor recognized opt-out signals; elsewhere, this processing may be required to use the free service. See the Privacy Policy for retention and details.
